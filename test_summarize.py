That's the worst yet meant to be an Eagle.Scary.With this come from.And then the detailed as.Oh, thank you.And somewhere that the body behind.Um?Do with it, but that was quite good. The fact that you could.Should we be making notes of this, we can just refer to this later comma I think, so I think I would be able to pull it up shared folders. Having said that, like if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market at the moment nest there about 20 pounds anyway.ButTo the other funk.We were not allowed to dim light so we can see that better.Again, this is off the top of my head. I was going to do a big cat too.I'm very impressed with your artistic skills. Mines are dreadful.MajesticAnd sum up the characteristics of that animal.And draw our favorite animal on the Whiteboard.And I see them.Oops, this is now coming apart. Let me just put the topping.It doesn't look like what I want it to be.Yeah.And a section opens up or something.There we go. Hope that pen is going to be OK.Yeah, about seventeen, 17,000 pounds.That was funny, right? Finance wise we've got selling price at 25.Right, yeah?You got both of these clipped on.Oh dear.It's not a vampire bat honestly.OK.As for everyone else.Yeah, and I'll have to think on the spot of things that is.I'm not going to ask you to guess. I'm going to tell you this was to be a Tiger.We're going to practice with the pens.I hope that clicks in, I'll just. I'll hold it on again.Am I supposed to be standing up?Pretty huge margin half.Any ideas?On Sony finds now that so call these pictures and stuff, which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do.Yeah, that's where.I mean, the Sky remote controls and everything. They're kind of molded and look a bit different and the Telewest.OK.Trendy, appealing to a wide market.And user friendly grannys to kids.I'm Sarah project.Over plastic, which I'd.So recording.I don't know. I don't know how I don't like that you know the new phones, that kind of got a Windows based running system.Cap there.I think that's a cost.People haven't thought.Now we're developing remote can.The other thing is just talking into mobile phone design features. Again, you have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is. You can have a bigger screen in the flip over.OK.But what you're saying about the does? It doesn't need to be fashionable the. So if I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the.And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish. Is a mobile phone. It can still be lightweight plastic, you know something that's easily moulded and produced. Sorry, I'm treading on your territory, guys.Talk about the project.This is our first.MeetingDiscuss our own ideas.I'm right, OK, we got half an hour before the next meeting, so we're going to go off and do it.Quite good, but yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be that you know that that was my main point. We do have to use metal. I don't know if using plastic doesn't make it cheaper. I presume it would. Yeah, yeah.Might save a bit of spaces instead of looking bulky. It might look small, yeah, but it might have cost implicate.Fantastic PowerPoint presentation. Just quick thing about the.With obvious pictures.Do some stuff, get to know each other.5 minutes to do that as far as I.And.WeProgram.Yeah, and I get to do.I don't, yeah.I think that's probably about it.Recording things like that inside it 'cause it doesn't make when you pick it up, it doesn't.Or bank kind of a jewel.It displays less on the screen, but as long as they can read it, that's the main thing.You sound or options.AnnAnd in that, you've got the basic buttons.Obvious what you're doing.Feel more comfortable.Then we'll go.Actually, that just raises the point. I wonder for design people think, but you know, on a mobile phone, you can press the key and it gives you a menu. It's got a menu display. I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful. So you've got a little LCD display. I was thinking on the same lines. You instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user, maybe have an LCD display or something like that, like a mobile with menus menus. Yeah, and if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse in.For your play volume.Obviously it displays less on the screen.Why everything's doing 'cause I mean menus?1st is.To use it.I don't think they tape thing. My Granddad that she better than me using teletext so right so that's a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with that is going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps and that's another issue. How we tackle that, why it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self intuitive and you can workout.Yeah, I don't. I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros, 50 how much.Or about the older generation about Granny and Grand.I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the phone. I have not gotten you one but my friend going.Do we go back to her room, yeah.FollowTrying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost.I'm going to save my credit can answer his mobile phone, but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. Can he programme his remote control or is he basic with that too?I mean I've got we got.WeatherSo.Yep.Yeah, it can be a crocodile. It can be a crocodile.It's actually sitting so sorry it's sitting. It's not standing OK. I see it as one thing. It's very supportive.OK.When you've got the main things on.3 videos..4 Euro would make a pound or something. Yeah, yeah.Control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button there and symbols that you don't necessarily understand. Symbols you meant to understand that you don't.1st, it's going to be in the into.She got.What happened there?Seconds.It's your best friend in your.Hopefully that'll stay on 200 version OK.Big Target group. Yeah yeah. I don't think we have to. I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that make.And you don't want to. I hate, I hate looking at.17These are the ones in seven 6.Thing all set up so we got one of the universal.Yeah.Flying around everywhere.Mens dogs can sometimes make out between a thief Anna.Person, so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog.CrocodileIndependent, independent right? Did you say they're good at golf?You got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by that of all age groups. Just we're not focusing on business market. Any particular thing? It's everyone user friendly to everyone, OK?Yeah, the program each of your things into.You want to integrate everything into one like yeah?So we have.The not so it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah, the main that's the main stuff anyway, I mean.And 13 it's got intuition.And also my drawing skill isn't that great. Well, as you can see, the quality of their work today is. I think it's outstandingly good.A kind of dog.Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make.Loyal.My experience is only been being given the remote control with the object I by not doing any tampering with it in programming. Using it to program TV videos and things, but basically on or volume up and down channel 1. Two that basic functions I don't think I could go any further with it.That kept losing."""
